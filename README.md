# gh-pages-blog #
=============

The simple way to use GitHub Pages as your account or project blog and website.


## About ##

gh-pages-blog is built upon the existing GitHub:Pages technologies, adding responsive Bootstrap, Font Awesome, JQuery, Disqus, Google Analytics, and some custom javascript to the mix to provide a fairly complete blogging solution.

## Credit ##

There are definitely a few projects that I need to give credit to:

[GitHub:Pages](http://pages.github.com) by GitHub

[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) by Twitter

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) by jQuery Foundation

[Font Awesome 3.0](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) by Dave Gandy

[syntax.css](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) by Tom Preston-Werner 

Without the above projects, gh-pages-blog probably wouldn't exist. Thanks to everyone working on those projects for all of their hard work and for releasing the code so that the rest of us can focus on other aspects of our sotware.
